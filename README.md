## About me
Hello! I'm a geeky-things enthusiast and aspiring developer whose passion for creating and building stuff was recently reignited by the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) course, which I'm currently learning from. Coding has opened up exciting new avenues for me to explore my creativity and challenge myself. Whether I'm navigating through dozens of pages of documentation or tackling seemingly impossible problems, I always find something new and interesting to learn.

But not only that, developing allows me to connect with a community of other people with amazing ideas of their own! Much like with mathematics or English, learning programming languages is a unique way to express certain thoughts in an organized, systematic manner, and also to read the thoughts of others and help solve their problems. Doesn't it broaden one's view to know different ways to communicate?

In fact, throughout my learning experience, I've come to appreciate the importance of effective communication and asking questions. When you hit a roadblock, being able to rely on your team is invaluable. This aligns perfectly with one of my main objectives: to become a reliable partner that others can count on. I aspire to be someone people can turn to for help, just as I will seek assistance from them countless times. 

Ultimately, I want to contribute meaningfully to the community in a way that feels authentic and not like another cookie-cutter approach. I understand this journey won't be short or easy, and it may never truly end, but I'm excited about the road ahead. Feel free to explore my projects and repositories to see a bit of this learning adventure of mine, if you desire.

## Projects
Here are the main projects I have authored up until now. They've helped me hone my problem-solving skills by building them from scratch, utilizing documentation and my own research.

### Applications

- **[Library](https://github.com/nekosoffy/library)** - **Insight:** dynamic DOM manipulation to reflect underlying data change;
- **[Weather Application](https://github.com/nekosoffy/weather-app)** - **Insight:** Fetch API for asynchronous requests and JSON parsing to handle the received data;
- **[Calculator](https://github.com/nekosoffy/calculator)** - **Insight:** event handling and event delegation.

### Games
- **[Battleship](https://github.com/nekosoffy/battleship)** - **Insight:** drag and drop implementation, game algorithm for CPU and thorough testing of public interface with Jest;
- **[Tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/nekosoffy/tic-tac-toe)** - **Insight:** modularity with factory functions and separation of concerns.

### Webpages
- **[Restaurant Page](https://github.com/nekosoffy/restaurant-page)** - **Insight:** use of Webpack, packages and helper functions to quickly generate whole pages with DOM methods;
- **[Dashboard](https://github.com/nekosoffy/dashboard)** - **Insight:** creation of a complex layout with strict use of CSS grid property;

## Some other things that motivate me
I'm passionate about games and challenges, but I'm especially captivated by RPGs (and I've recently delved into [modding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding))! It gives me joy to explore the diverse, rich stories that comes from them. Even though some may consider me a sunny person, I'd say my best days are cloudy, rainy days: they're comforting and inspire my thoughts. Then, like a cherry on a cake, give me a playlist of indie or alternative music and I have the perfect mood set for whatever it is that I'm doing. As a kind of an introvert, my good nose for witty humor is what leads me to forge friendships. I have a strong interest in science, so when I'm not coding, it's not a far guess that I'm probably reading about a random intriguing topic on the subject. 

Aside from that, I have a little bit of a foot in health, fashion, self-care, and the art world, with a particular fondness for pixel art. Lately, I've learned that education is something that really draws me. Who knows if I end up on the field someday, mentoring other developers? What I do know, though, is that accessibility has been a growing concern of mine since grasping just how important it is for users of digital technologies, and I hope to be able to understand it better every day and make this a paradigm for the projects I work on.
